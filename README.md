This is my greaduate projection, I will add a short introduction about this project on May 1st.

[spark-Multiple Maps of tSNE](https://github.com/bigheiniu/spark-MM-tsne) is based on [spark-tsne](https://github.com/saurfang/spark-tsne/). MM-tSNE utilize multiple maps of low dimention data to simulate high dimention data.
